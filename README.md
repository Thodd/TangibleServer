TangibleServer
==============

A Tangible-Websocket Bridge to access Pixelsense-Tags from JavaScript.

Microsoft's Surface SDK 2.0 for their Pixelsense (SUR40) device, offers the capability to access `Tags`.
Tags are nothing more than proprietary optical markers, used to track physical objects on the Pixelsense Multi-Touch-Table.

This project implements a simple Websockets interface in order to transmit the native Windows Touch-/Tag-Events to the browser.



### Dependencies
